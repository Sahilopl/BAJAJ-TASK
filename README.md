2. **Set up the development environment**: Install all necessary dependencies and set up your local environment.
3. **Build your app**: Develop and customize your app by editing the components, filters, and UI as needed.
4. **Deploy using Vercel**: Once you're happy with your changes, deploy the app directly to Vercel for easy hosting.
5. **Automatic Deployment**: After deploying, every change you make in your project is automatically pushed to the repository, ensuring Vercel always serves the latest version.
6. **Continuous Updates**: Any updates made on the Vercel interface will automatically reflect on your live site and be pushed to the GitHub repository for version control.
